\section{Conclusion}

These three works, Jetset, \emph{Story Beyond the Eye}, and InteGreat, present three novel perspectives on the recovery of models from binary code.
In the first, the models were expression sets corresponding to the constraints of hardware peripheral interactions.
The second involved the more complex extraction and hand-modeling of glyph shifting schemes used to determine the information leaked by redacted text.
Finally, the third presented a more formal and sophisticated model for the extraction of meaningful abstractions from symbol-stripped, binary code.

As a whole, these works indicate a number of hard problems in the domain of binary program analysis, including the resolution and modeling of precise, discrete floating point operations and their relationship to the real domain, the ability to avoid difficulties incurred in developing a general solution to the halting problem through the use of abstraction, and the impossibility of perfectly rehosting a firmware image into an emulator and accurately interacting with it without \emph{some} knowledge of physical factors and additional hardware that plays a role in the system.

However, the resulting publications also make significant strides towards identifying the proper responses to each of these problems through the use of abstraction, careful evaluation of the algorithms under study, consideration of microarchitectural semantics, and novel binary analysis techniques.
The proposed dissertation will work to unify these findings and present them within a framework that is at once both detailed, empirically justified, clear, and unified.
It will also work to outline the core limitations of these works, and therefore provide useful commentary for future work in the domain of binary program analysis.

\section{Time Line}

As the present author has present commitments for employment regardless of the outcome of his doctoral work, the dissertation will be subject to practical constraints on time in accordance with the current University of Illinois policies on dissertation timelines.
The absolute minimum time between the preliminary exam proposal and defense is four months, and the current scheduled date of the exam is February 24th.
As a result of aforementioned employment constraints, the present author intends to complete the writing of the defense by July 2023 and the proposed defense will occur at the end of this same month, the schedules of the defense committee permitting and considering all other university requirements have been fulfilled.
